## 🎮 Game Description

**Cop and Bandit** is a high-speed, adrenaline-pumping chase game built from the ground up for performance and visual fidelity on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4). Experience smooth 60FPS+ gameplay, vibrant colors, and a procedural city that never ends.

**Key Features:**
*   **Apple Silicon Native:** Fully optimized for M-series chips with Metal-compatible OpenGL 3.2.

*   **Procedural Generation:** Every run is unique with a procedurally generated city.
*   **Clean & Fast:** Minimal codebase designed for speed.

## 📖 The Story

The city is your playground, but the law is always one step behind.

You play as the **Bandit**, a skilled skater with a knack for trouble. You've just pulled off the heist of the century, but the **Cop** is hot on your tail!

Grab your skateboard and hit the streets. Dodge traffic, weave through obstacles, and collect as many **Coins** as you can. But be careful—one wrong move, and it's game over.

*   **Collect** Gold, Silver, and Bronze coins to boost your score.
*   **Grab** the Skateboards for speed boosts.
*   **Survive** as long as you can in this endless runner!
